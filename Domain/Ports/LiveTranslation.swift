//  Online translation: the phone listens to surrounding speech (studied language) and streams a
//  live translation (native language). Backend-agnostic — the port leaks no audio/transport types;
//  the live adapter (Soniox WebSocket) owns the microphone, the cloud session, and the on-disk
//  session recording. A companion port plays back / deletes stored session recordings.
