//  Product analytics port. Use cases report FEATURE-level events through this abstraction; the
//  concrete backend (TelemetryDeck) lives in the Data layer and is wired at the composition root.
//
//  PRIVACY: events are a CLOSED enum with no payload, so no user content (intents, translations,
//  photos) can ever leak into analytics — there is simply nowhere to put it.
