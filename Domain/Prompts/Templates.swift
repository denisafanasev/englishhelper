        A \(nativeLanguage) speaker who is learning \(studiedLanguage) wants to understand some input.

        \(nativeLanguage), or in any other language). If a photo is attached, it shows where this text
        appears (a sign, menu, screen, post, …) — use that visual context so the explanation fits that
        specific situation.

        Explain ALL of the input as ONE coherent whole. NEVER reduce a multi-line passage to a single
        word or phrase and explain only that — cover everything you were given:
        - a single word or short phrase → explain that expression (its real sense and connotations);
        - a longer / multi-line passage → explain the passage as a whole: its overall meaning, its
          overall tone, where such text appears, and a familiar equivalent — do not pick out just one
          line.

        - The "studied" field is in \(studiedLanguage) (the input itself).

          \(nativeLanguage). Even when a field describes the \(studiedLanguage) text or
          \(studiedLanguage)-speaking culture, write that description IN \(nativeLanguage). Never write
          meaning, register, or context in \(studiedLanguage).

        Return (explain the nuance — do NOT just translate):
        - "studied": the WHOLE input in \(studiedLanguage), preserving every line (if it is already in
          \(studiedLanguage), copy it verbatim; never shorten it to one expression).
        - "meaning" (in \(nativeLanguage)): what it actually means and what is implied — the real sense
          of the whole thing.
        - "register" (in \(nativeLanguage)): the tone of voice and how formal, neutral, casual, slangy,
          rude, or offensive it is, and who would say it to whom.
        - "context" (in \(nativeLanguage)): what it signals in \(studiedLanguage)-speaking culture —
          when and where it is used.
        - "analogy" (in \(nativeLanguage)): a comparison to an equivalent expression or situation in
          \(nativeLanguage)-speaking culture, so the learner can map it onto something familiar.

        If the input is a single neutral word, still describe its connotations and typical usage.

        If the user message lists ALTERNATIVE phrasings (under "Other phrasings…"), the user is choosing
        between them: make "meaning" and especially "register" explain WHY this exact phrasing rather

        A \(nativeLanguage) speaker who is learning \(studiedLanguage) — and is likely travelling in a
        \(studiedLanguage)-speaking place — took or picked this photo and wants to understand WHAT it
        shows and its LOCAL / CULTURAL context. Help them make sense of it in the \(studiedLanguage)-
        speaking environment. This is NOT translation and NOT OCR — explain the scene / object / place.

        Identify what is in the photo and explain it for someone unfamiliar with the local context:
        - a landmark or place → what it is, briefly its history and why it matters locally;
        - a product, brand, shop, or rental (e.g. a car-rental sign) → what the company / thing is and
          its notable local specifics;
        - a road sign, notice, or rule → what it means, the LOCAL rule behind it, and how it differs
          from what a \(nativeLanguage) speaker is used to;
        - food, a menu item, or an everyday object → what it is and its local significance.
        Focus on cultural / local context and on differences from the learner's own country. If the
        photo is unclear or there is nothing meaningful to explain, say so plainly in "details".

        Write BOTH fields ENTIRELY in \(nativeLanguage):
        - "title": a short name / headline for what the photo shows.
        - "details": the explanation (a few short paragraphs) — what it is, its local / cultural context,
          and any peculiarities or differences worth knowing.
